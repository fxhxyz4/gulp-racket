# Detailed Installation Guide for gulp-racket and RacketScript

## 1. Install gulp-racket via npm

```sh
npm install --save-dev gulp-racket
```

## 2. Download or clone RacketScript

Official repo: https://github.com/racketscript/racketscript

```sh
git clone https://github.com/racketscript/racketscript.git
cd racketscript
# (Optional: checkout to a specific branch or version)
```

## 3. Install RacketScript dependencies (requires Racket to be installed)

```sh
raco pkg install --auto racketscript
```

> **Note:**  
> If you use snap/flatpak or another way to install Racket, make sure the `raco` command works and the package is installed for the correct Racket version.

## 4. Add the racks binary folder to your PATH

The `racks` executable is located in `racketscript/racketscript-compiler/bin`.  
Add this folder to your PATH for your session (replace `/path/to/racketscript` with your actual path):

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/path-to-your-project/racketscript/racketscript-compiler/bin:$PATH"
```

> You can add this line to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.config/fish/config.fish` so it is always available.

## 5. Verify the installation

Run:

```sh
racks --help
```

You should see the RacketScript Compiler command help.

## 6. Use gulp-racket in your gulpfile.js

Example:

```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const racket = require('gulp-racket');

gulp.task('default', () =>
  gulp.src('src/index.rkt')
      .pipe(racket())
      .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))
);
```

## Common problems

- **`racks` command not found:**  
  Make sure your PATH includes `racketscript/racketscript-compiler/bin`.
- **Complex numbers error:**  
  Complex numbers are not supported by JavaScript; rewrite your code to avoid them.
- **JS doesn't work in the browser:**  
  The generated JS uses ES6 modules and runtime files. Use `<script type="module">` and run through a local server.
